# HashCode2021

My solution to the practice problem and online qualification round of the hashcode 2021.
(Refer to main.py file in respective folders)<br> <br>
This was my first time participating in Google Hashcode and it was fun. Also some how my team managed to get more than zero in the competition :P <br> <br>
The Traffic Scheduling logic of mine is neither  good nor is optimised completely but still it worked on the input files and gave my team a pretty good score.
